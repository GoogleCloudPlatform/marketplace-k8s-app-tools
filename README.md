# Overview

This repository contains a set of tools supporting the development of Kubernetes
manifests deployable via Google Cloud Marketplace. These tools will be updated
as Google Cloud Marketplace's supports additional deployment mechanisms (e.g.
[Helm](https://helm.sh)) and adopts ongoing community standard (e.g. SIG Apps defined [Application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application)).

For examples of how these tools are used, see
[marketplace-k8s-app-example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-example).

# Getting Started

## Tool dependencies

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). You can install this tool as part of `gcloud`.
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/Installation)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Authorization

This guide assumes you are using a local development environment. If you need
to run these instructions from a GCE VM or use a service account identity
(e.g. for testing), see: [Advanced Authorization](#advanced-authorization)

Log in as yourself by running:

```shell
gcloud auth login
```

## Provisioning a GKE cluster and configuring kubectl to connect to it.

```
CLUSTER=cluster-1
ZONE=us-west1-a

# Create the cluster.
gcloud beta container clusters create "$CLUSTER" \
    --zone "$ZONE" \
    --machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
    --num-nodes "3"

# Configure kubectl authorization.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$CLUSTER" --zone "$ZONE"

# Bootstrap RBAC cluster-admin for your user.
# More info: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $(gcloud config get-value account)

# (Optional) Start up kubectl proxy.
kubectl proxy
```

## Setting up GCR

https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/containerregistry.googleapis.com

## Updating git submodules

This repo utilizes git submodules. This repo should typically be included in your
application repo as a submodule as well. Run the following commands to make sure that
all submodules are properly populated (`git clone` does not populate submodules by
default).

```shell
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --recursive --init --force
```

## Building and installing your application

Follow the examples at
[marketplace-k8s-app-example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-example).

From within your application source directory, follow these steps for a quick start:

* `make crd/install` to install the application CRD on the cluster. This needs to be
  done only once.
* `make app/install` to build all the container images and deploy the app to a target
  namespace on the cluster.
* `make app/uninstall` to delete the deployed app.

# Development guide

## Coding style

We follow [Google's coding style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).

## Makefile Overview

* `app.Makefile`: Application `Makefile` should include this.
    * Application `Makefile` should define `app/build::` target to specify how to
      build application containers
    * `app.Makefile` defines 2 main targets to manage the lifecycle of the application
      on the cluster in a target namespace: `make app/install` and `make app/uninstall`.
    * `app.Makefile` also defines an utility target to validate the overall funcionality
      of the application, `make app/verify`.

* `crd.Makefile`: Include this to expose `make crd/install` and `make crd/uninstall`.

* `gcloud.Makefile`: Include this to conveniently derive the registry and target
  namespace from local `gcloud` and `kubectl` configurations. Without this, user has
  to define these via environment variables.

* `marketplace.Makefile`: Included as part of `app.Makefile`. Your application
  build target typically depends on one or more targets in this file. For example,
  your application might need the base `helm` deployer container to build upon.

* `ubbagent.Makefile`: Include this if your application needs to build [usage base
  metering agent](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ubbagent).

# Appendix

## Advanced Authorization

### Running on a GCE VM

If you're running from a GCE VM, your VM must have
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email` scope in order for it to
reveal the correct user name to GKE. No straight forward way to add scopes to a
VM once it's created. The easiest is to set the scope when creating the VM:

```shell
gcloud compute instances create \
  [INSTANCE_NAME] \
  --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
  --scopes cloud-platform,userinfo-email
```

To check the scopes currently granted:
```shell
curl "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/tokeninfo?access_token=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
```

### Running as a service account

By default, gcloud run from GCE VMs have credentials associated with the
service account, rather than a user. We recommend configuring it to authorize
as a user (see command above) to be consistent with the Marketplace end-user
experience.

If this is not an option (e.g. integration testing), see the following:

By default, the Compute service account that the VM authorizes as does not have
k8s engine admin privilege. You need to grant that role to the service account
via the IAM Admin console.

## Defining app parameters with schema.yaml file

The `schema.yaml` file is the way to declare parameter values that end-user needs to provide
in order to provision the application. For example, the name of the application, the kubernetes
namespace, service accounts, etc. It follows a more strict subset of JSON schema specifications.
The UI uses `schema.yaml` to render the form that end-users will interact with to configure and
deploy the application.

The information provided by the user for properties defined in `schema.yaml` is available at deployment time. 

This is a simple example of a schema.yaml file:

```yaml
application_api_version: v1beta
properties:
  name:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAME
  namespace:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAMESPACE
required:
- name
- namespace
```

Each entry is defined inside properties, and `required` is a list of required parameters.
We validate that all required fields are provided before starting the deployment.

### Referencing `schema.yaml` parameter values in kubernetes manifests

All parameters defined in `schema.yaml` can be used in manifests.

#### Helm based deployer

They can be referenced in helm charts just like a regular value from `values.yaml`. 

Example of `schema.yaml`

```yaml
application_api_version: v1beta
properties:
  port:
    type: string
  name:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAME
  namespace:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAMESPACE
required:
- name
- namespace
- port
```

Usage example of the value of `port` in a helm chart:

```yaml
...
      containers:
        - name: "myContainer"
          image: "myImage"
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: {{ .Values.port }}
...
```

Notice that:
- Values defined in `schema.yaml` will overlay values defined in `values.yaml`. For example, if 
`values.yaml` looks like the following:

```yaml
port: 80
```

but the value of `port` is set to 21 by the user, the value 21 will be used.

- Dots can be used for referencing nested values. For example, if the app makes use of 
`values.yaml` like below:

```yaml
mysql:
  image: <path to image>
```

the property can ve referenced in the schema file as `mysql.image`

```yaml
application_api_version: v1beta
properties:
  mysql.image:
    type: string
...
```

#### Envsubs based deployer

They can be referenced in manifests by its name in `schema.yaml`, prefixed with $.

Example of `schema.yaml`

```yaml
application_api_version: v1beta
properties:
  port:
    type: string
  name:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAME
  namespace:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAMESPACE
required:
- name
- namespace
- port
```

Usage example of the value of `port` in a helm chart:

```yaml
...
      containers:
        - name: "myContainer"
          image: "myImage"
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: $port
...
```

Schema.yaml specification
---

### application_api_version

Specifies the version of the application CRD. 

Supports versions starting from `v1beta1`.

### Properties

#### type

Represents the type of the input in the form for that property.

##### Supported types
- `string`
- `integer`
- `boolean`

#### title

Displayed text in the ui.

#### description

Explanation of what the property is or what is used for. Be mindful of good explanation as a way to improve user experience.

#### default

If user does not provide a value, `default` will be used.

#### minimum

The value has to be greater or equal than `minimum`.

#### maximum

The value has to be less or equal than `maximum`.

#### maxLength

The value length has to be less or equal than `maxLength`.

#### pattern

A regex pattern. The value needs to match `pattern`.

#### x-google-marketplace

This serves as an annotation to tell gcp to handle that property in a special way, depending on `type`. 
It has several usages and more will be added based on demand.

#### [Examples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-example/blob/master/wordpress/schema.yaml).

---
### x-google-marketplace

#### type

It defines how this object will be handled. Each type has a different set of properties.

##### Supported types
- `NAME`: To be used as the name of the app.
- `NAMESPACE`: To be used as the kubernetes namespace where the app will installed.
- `IMAGE`: Link to a docker image.
- `GENERATED_PASSWORD`: A value to be generated at deployment time, following common password requirements.
- `REPORTING_SECRET`: The Secret resource name containing the usage reporting credentials
- `SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: The name of a pre-provisioned k8s `ServiceAccount`. If it does not exist, one is created.
- `STORAGE_CLASS`: The name of a pre-provisioned k8s `StorageClass`. If it does not exist, one is created.
- `STRING`: A string that needs special handling.

---

#### type: GENERATED_PASSWORD

Example:

```yaml
dbPassword:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: GENERATED_PASSWORD
      generatedPassword:
        length: 16
```
---

#### type: SERVICE_ACCOUNT

Defining a `ServiceAccount` as a resource to be deployed will cause deployer to fail with authentication errors,
because the deployer doesn't run with privileges that allow creating them. 
All service accounts need to be defined as parameters in `schema.yaml`.

Example:

```yaml
properties:
  operatorServiceAccount:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: SERVICE_ACCOUNT
      serviceAccount:
        roles:
        - type: ClusterRole        # This is a cluster-wide ClusterRole
          rulesType: PREDEFINED
          rulesFromRoleName: edit  # Use predefined role named "edit"
        - type: Role               # This is a namespaced Role
          rulesType: CUSTOM        # We specify our own custom RBAC rules
          rules:
          - apiGroups: ['apps.kubernetes.io/v1alpha1']
            resources: ['Application']
            verbs: ['*']
        - type: ClusterRole
          rulesType: CUSTOM
          rules:
          - apiGroups: ['etcd.database.coreos.com/v1beta2']
            resources: ['EtcdCluster']  
            verbs: ['*']
```
---

#### type: STORAGE_CLASS

Defining a `StorageClass` as a resource to be deployed will cause deployer to fail with authentication errors,
because the deployer doesn't run with privileges that allow creating them. 
All storage classes need to be defined as parameters in `schema.yaml`.

```yaml
properties:
  ssdStorageClass:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: STORAGE_CLASS
      storageClass:
        type: SSD
```

#### type: STRING

This is used to represent a string that needs special handling, for example base64 representation.

Example:

```yaml
properties:
  explicitPassword:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: STRING
      string:
        generatedProperties:
          base64Encoded: explicitPasswordEncoded
```

In the example above, manifests can reference to the password as `explicitPassword`, as well as to its base64Encoded value as `explicitPasswordEncoded`.
