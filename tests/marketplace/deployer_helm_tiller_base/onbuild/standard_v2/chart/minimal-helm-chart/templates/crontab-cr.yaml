# The CronTab CRD is defined in a subchart to ensure it exists
# before the CR is instantiated.
#
# If CRs are only instantiated by the app itself
# (i.e. are not included in deployer manifests)
# then the CR does not need to be in a subchart.
# (example: /tests/marketplace/deployer_envsubst_base/standard_v2)
