# Creating a deployer schema

You need a `schema.yaml` file when you
[build your deployer](building-deployer.md).

The schema file provides the following:
- Information about the current release, such as its release version, release
  notes, etc.
- A declaration and parameterization of all images used by the app. These images
  must be explicitly declared for security scanning, open source compliance, and
  republishing to the Google Cloud Marketplace Google Container Registry (GCR).
  They must be accepted as parameters because their final locations will only be
  known at the time of deployment.
- The parameters that users can customize when they deploy the app, and
  how they are rendered in the deployment configuration UI.
- Cluster constraints and requirements, such as the minimum required version of
  Kubernetes.

## Overview

In your deployer image, you must add the schema file at `/data/schema.yaml`.

The format of `schema.yaml` follows a subset of JSON schema specifications, and
supports Google Cloud Marketplace-specific extensions.

There are currently two versions of the schema. You can choose to follow either
the `v1` or `v2` specifications for your `schema.yaml` file, but we recommend
that you use the `v2` specification, as this will soon be required for all new apps.

This is a basic example of a `schema.yaml` file. This schema declares two standard
parameters that users must specify when deploying the app: the name of the
app instance, and the Kubernetes namespace.

```yaml
# v1 or v2 specific sections are omitted.

properties:
  name:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAME
  namespace:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAMESPACE
required:
- name
- namespace
```

## V2 specification

```yaml
x-google-marketplace:
  # MUST be v2.
  schemaVersion: v2

  # MUST match the version of the Application custom resource object.
  # This is the same as the top level applicationApiVersion field in v1.
  applicationApiVersion: v1beta1

  # The release version is required in the schema and MUST match the
  # release tag on the the deployer.
  publishedVersion: '0.1.1'
  publishedVersionMetadata:
    releaseNote: >-
      Initial release.
    # releaseTypes list is optional.
    # "Security" should only be used if this is an important update to patch
    # an existing vulnerability.
    releaseTypes:
    - Feature
    - BugFix
    - Security
    # Setting "recommended" to "true" indicates that users are encouraged
    # to update as soon as possible.
    recommended: true

  # Image declaration is required here. Refer to the Images section below.
  images: {}

  # Other fields, like clusterConstraints, can be included here.

# The Properties and Required sections of v2 are structured the same as those of v1.
properties: {}
```

### (Required) `schemaVersion`

The version of the schema. The value must be `v2`.

### (Required) `applicationApiVersion`

The version of the Application Custom Resource object. This version must
be `v1beta1` or newer.

### (Required) `publishedVersion`

The
[release version of the app](building-deployer.md#tagging-your-deployer-image),
as a string. This must match the release tag on all your app images. For example, `'1.0.5'`.

### `publishedVersionMetadata`

Information about the version.

#### `releaseNote`

Information about the release, using the
[YAML folding style, with a block chomping indicator](https://yaml-multiline.info).
For example:

```yaml
releaseNote: >-
  Bug fixes and performance enhancements.
```

#### `releaseTypes`

A list of release types, which can be one or more of the following:

- `Feature`
- `BugFix`
- `Security`. We recommend using `Security` only if the update addresses a
  critical security issue. In the Google Cloud Console, security updates are
  displayed more prominently than other types of updates.

#### `recommended`

A boolean that indicates whether the update is recommended, such as for a
security update. If `true`, users are encouraged to update as soon as possible.

### Image declaration and parameterization

A declaration and parameterization of all images used in your app. Since the
images are republished, and end users will use the versions republished in
Google Cloud Marketplace's public Container Registry, all workloads must
also parameterize the image fields. At deploy time, the final locations of
the images will be available via property values declared here. You should
not rely on knowing these final locations ahead of time, as they can change.

Here is an example `images` section:

```yaml
x-google-marketplace:
  images:
    '':  # Primary image has no name.
      properties:
        imageRepo:
          type: REPO_WITH_REGISTRY
        imageTag:
          type: TAG
    proxy:
      properties:
        imageProxyFull:
          type: FULL
        imageProxyRegistry:
          type: REGISTRY
        imageProxyRepo:
          type: REPO_WITHOUT_REGISTRY
        imageProxyTag:
          type: TAG
```

This example section declares two images, in addition to the deployer:

`gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app:1.0.1`
`gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app/proxy:1.0.1`

Their names are set as declared within the `images` section; their shared
prefix `gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app` is determined externally to
the `schema.yaml` file, when you onboard your app for publishing.

The images can be passed as parameters or values to your app templates or
charts (as applicable) by using the `properties` section. Each property can
pass either the full image name or a specific part of it, depending on its
assigned `type`:

- `FULL` passes the entire image name,
  `gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app:1.0.1`
- `REGISTRY` only passes the initial `gcr.io`
- `REPO_WITHOUT_REGISTRY` passes only the repo, without the registry or tag;
  for example, `your-project/your-company/your-app`
- `REPO_WITH_REGISTRY` passes the repo, with the registry and without the
  tag; for example, `gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app`
- `TAG` only passes the image tag, which in this case is `1.0.1`

In the earlier example, the `proxy` image is passed to the template with
the following values:

- `imageProxyFull=gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app:1.0.1`
- `imageProxyRegistry=gcr.io`
- `imageProxyRepo=your-project/your-company/your-app`
- `imageProxyTag=1.0.1`

The primary image above is passed under 2 different parameters/values:

- `imageRepo=gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app`
- `imageTag=1.0.1`

Note that when users deploy your app from Google Cloud Marketplace, the final
image names are different, but follow the same release tag and name prefix rule.
For example, the published images could be under:

- `marketplace.gcr.io/your-company/your-app:1.0.1`
- `marketplace.gcr.io/your-company/your-app/deployer:1.0.1`
- `marketplace.gcr.io/your-company/your-app/proxy:1.0.1`

## v1 specification

```yaml
# MUST match the version of the Application custom resource object.
# This is the same as the top level applicationApiVersion field in v1.
applicationApiVersion: v1beta1

# The Properties and Required sections of v1 are structured the same as those of v2.
properties: {}
```

### (Required) `applicationApiVersion`

The version of the Application Custom Resource object. This version must
be `v1beta1` or newer.

### Image declaration and parameterization

A declaration and parameterization of all images used in your app. Since the
images are republished, and end users will use the versions republished in
Google Cloud Marketplace's public Container Registry, all workloads must also
parameterize the image fields. At deploy time, the final locations of the
images will be available via property values declared here. You should not
rely on knowing these final locations ahead of time, as they can change.

In `v1`, images are declared inside the `properties` section, as follows:

```yaml
properties:
  mainImageName:
    type: string
    default: gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app:1.0.1
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: IMAGE
  proxyImageName:
    type: string
    default: gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app/proxy:1.0.1
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: IMAGE
```

This example declares two images, in addition to the deployer:

`gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app:1.0.1`
`gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app/proxy:1.0.1`

The `default` values specify the images' names, and are required.

Note that the images share a common prefix
`gcr.io/your-project/your-company/your-app`, which is set externally to the
`schema.yaml` file, when you onboard your app for publishing. If your app
contains a primary image, its repository must exactly match the common prefix
of the images.

The two declared properties, `mainImageName` and `proxyImageName`, receive the
final republished images when end users deploy the app.

When users deploy your app from Google Cloud Marketplace, the final image names
may be different, but they will follow the same release tag and name prefix rule.
For example, the published images could be under:

- `marketplace.gcr.io/your-company/your-app:1.0.1`
- `marketplace.gcr.io/your-company/your-app/deployer:1.0.1`
- `marketplace.gcr.io/your-company/your-app/proxy:1.0.1`

Note: `IMAGE` properties are not visible in the configuration UI.

## Properties

This section is a part of both the `v1` and `v2` schemas.

The properties declared within the `properties` section define which
parameters are displayed in the configuration UI form and customized by users
before the app is deployed.

`required` is a list of required parameters, for which users must provide a
value prior to deployment.

### Helm chart values

Each property defined in the schema maps to a Helm value, as defined in the
Helm chart's `values.yaml` file. The properties in the schema should be a
subset of the keys defined in `values.yaml`. For properties that map to nested
fields in `values.yaml`, you can use the dot (`.`) notation in your schema.

Default values in the schema override default values in `values.yaml`, as do
any user-supplied inputs, as defined by the `properties` section of the schema.

The `x-google-marketplace` section of the schema always requires a `NAME` and `NAMESPACE`. These fields map to the Helm chart's `Release.Name` and `Release.Namespace` directives, respectively.

For example, let's say you have the following `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
database:
  image:
    name: gcr.io/google/mysql:5.6
replicas: 3
```

We can define the following abbreviated schema:

```yaml
properties:
  name:       # maps to Helm's Release.Name directive
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAME
  namespace:  # maps to Helm's Release.Namespace directive
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAMESPACE
  replicas:
    type: integer
    default: 3
  database.image.name:  # use a dot to map to the nested field in values.yaml
    type: string
    default: gcr.io/google/mysql:5.6
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: IMAGE
```

### Referencing values in an `envsubst`-based deployer

All of the parameters defined in `schema.yaml` can be used in your Kubernetes
manifests. To use a parameter, use the name you defined in `schema.yaml`,
prefixed with `$`.

For example, consider this `schema.yaml`:

```yaml
applicationApiVersion: v1beta1
properties:
  port:
    type: string
  name:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAME
  namespace:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAMESPACE
required:
- name
- namespace
- port
```

To use the value of `port` in the manifest, use `$port`:

```yaml
...
      containers:
        - name: "myContainer"
          image: "myImage"
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: $port
...
```

### Property specifications

For each property, you can define the following sub-properties:

#### `title`

The text shown in the in the Google Cloud Marketplace UI when users configure
their deployment.

![Custom property in the UI](images/custom-property-ui.png)

#### `type`

The data type of the property. The supported types are:

- `string`
- `integer`
- `boolean`

#### `description`

A short description of the property, shown as a tooltip in the interface.
If the description requires more than a paragraph, consider adding more detail
in your user guides.

#### `default`

A default value for the property, if users don't provide a value.

#### `enum`

A list of valid values for the property, shown as a drop-down menu. To define
your list, use the following syntax:

```yaml
  testProperty:
    type: string
    title: Test property
    description: My Test Property
    enum:
    - 'Value 1'
    - 'Value 2'
    - 'Value 3'
```

![Enum property UI](images/enum-property-ui.png)

#### `minimum`

If the property is a number, the minimum value that users must enter.
The value must be greater than or equal to `minimum`.

#### `maximum`

If the property is a number, the maximum value that users can enter.
The value must be less than or equal to `maximum`.

#### `maxLength`

For `string` properties, the maximum length of the value.

#### `pattern`

A regex pattern. The value must match `pattern`.

#### `x-google-marketplace`

When you add this annotation, you must also specify a `type`, described in
[Property `x-google-marketplace.type`](#property-x-google-marketplace-type).

### Property `x-google-marketplace.type`

Defines how the property must be handled by Google Cloud Marketplace. Each type
has a different set of properties.

#### Supported types

- `NAME`: Indicates that the property is the name of the app.
- [`NAMESPACE`](#type-namespace): Indicates that the property is the Kubernetes
  namespace where the app will installed.
- `REPORTING_SECRET`: The Secret resource name that contains the credentials
  for usage reports. These credentials are used by the
  [usage-based billing agent](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ubbagent).
- [`MASKED_FIELD`](#type-masked_field): A string value whose characters will be
  masked when entered in the UI.
- [`GENERATED_PASSWORD`](#type-generated_password): Indicates that the property
  is a value to be generated when the app is deployed.
- [`SERVICE_ACCOUNT`](#type-service_account): The name of a pre-provisioned
  Kubernetes `ServiceAccount`. If the ServiceAccount does not exist, a new one
  is created when users deploy the app.
- [`STORAGE_CLASS`](#type-storage_class): The name of a pre-provisioned
  Kubernetes `StorageClass`. If the StorageClass does not exist, a new one is
  created when users deploy the app.
- [`STRING`](#type-string): A string that needs special handling, such as a
  string that is base64-encoded.
- [`APPLICATION_UID`](#type-application_uid): The UUID of the created
  `Application` object.
- [`ISTIO_ENABLED`](#type-istio_enabled): Indicates whether [Istio](https://istio.io)
  is enabled on the cluster for the deployment.
- [`INGRESS_AVAILABLE`](#type-ingress_available): Indicates whether the cluster is
  detected to have Ingress support.
- [`TLS_CERTIFICATE`](#type-tls_certificate): This is used to support a custom
  certificate, or to generate a self-signed certificate.
- [`DEPLOYER_IMAGE`](#type-deployer_image): Indicates that the property is the
  name of the Docker deployer image.

#### type: MASKED_FIELD

Indicates that this is a property where the value that the user enters must be
masked. Use this annotation for fields such as passwords chosen by the user.
In the Google Cloud Marketplace UI, users will also see an option to reveal the
value as plain text.

Example:

```yaml
properties:
  customSecret:
    title: User-specified password
    description: The password to be used for login.
    maxLength: 32
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: MASKED_FIELD
```

#### type: NAMESPACE

This property is required. It specifies the target namespace where all of app
resources are installed.

Properties of this type will have their user-entered value masked by default
in the UI, offering the user the option to reveal the value as plain text.

A `default` value can be specified, in which case the UI will auto-select the
default namespace instead of using its typical heuristics for picking or
creating a namespace.

Example:

```yaml
properties:
  namespace:
    type: string
    default: desired-fixed-namespace
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAMESPACE
```

#### type: GENERATED_PASSWORD

Example:

```yaml
properties:
  dbPassword:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: GENERATED_PASSWORD
      generatedPassword:
        length: 16
        includeSymbols: False  # Default is False
        base64: True           # Default is True
```

- If `includeSymbols` is `True`, the special characters are included in the
  generated password.
- If `base64` is `True`, the generated password is passed as a base64-encoded
  value. This means that it can be used directly in a `Secret` manifest. If the
  value is to be encoded in your Helm template, this property should be set to
  `False`.

#### type: SERVICE_ACCOUNT

All service accounts need to be defined as parameters in `schema.yaml`.

If you add a Kubernetes `ServiceAccount` as a resource in your manifest, the
deployment fails with an authentication error, because the deployer doesn't run
with enough privileges to create a Service Account by default.

When permissions involve modifying resources, custom roles are prefered over
predefined roles. In accordance with the principle of least privilege, predefined
`cluster-admin`, `admin`, and `edit` are not supported as cluster-scoped roles;
`CUSTOM` roles defining specific rules must be used instead.

If you only need to create cluster-scoped resources to initialize (vs. run)
your app, specify these permissions in the
[`deployerServiceAccount`](#deployerserviceaccount) field instead.

The following `schema.yaml` example snippet adds a Service Account with
Cluster Roles:

```yaml
properties:
  operatorServiceAccount:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: SERVICE_ACCOUNT
      serviceAccount:
        description: >
          Monitors cluster-wide app dependencies (such as x and y),
          managing CoreOS application instances and their etcdclusters.
        roles:
        - type: ClusterRole        # This is a cluster-wide ClusterRole
          rulesType: PREDEFINED
          rulesFromRoleName: view  # Use predefined role named "view"
        - type: Role               # This is a namespaced Role
          rulesType: CUSTOM        # We specify our own custom RBAC rules
          rules:
          - apiGroups: ['apps.kubernetes.io']
            resources: ['applications']
            verbs: ['*']
        - type: ClusterRole
          rulesType: CUSTOM
          rules:
          - apiGroups: ['etcd.database.coreos.com']
            resources: ['etcdclusters']
            verbs: ['*']
```

The `description` field (required) should indicate the service account's purpose
and explain why it needs the requested permissions, particularly cluster-scoped
permissions. It may be shown to users in the UI.

#### type: STORAGE_CLASS

All Storage Classes need to be defined as parameters in `schema.yaml`.

If you add a Kubernetes `StorageClass` as a resource in your manifest, the
deployment will fail with an authentication error, because the deployer doesn't
run with enough privileges to create a Storage Class.

For example, this `schema.yaml` snippet creates a Storage Class:

```yaml
properties:
  ssdStorageClass:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: STORAGE_CLASS
      storageClass:
        type: SSD
```

The created `StorageClass` has the name `<namespace>-<app_name>-<property_name>`.

#### type: STRING

This is used to represent a string that needs special handling, such as a
base64-encoded string.

Example:

```yaml
properties:
  explicitPassword:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: STRING
      string:
        generatedProperties:
          base64Encoded: explicitPasswordEncoded
```

In the example above, manifests can reference the password as
`explicitPassword`, and its base64Encoded value as `explicitPasswordEncoded`.

#### type: APPLICATION_UID

When the deployer runs, a placeholder `Application` object is created.
A property annotated with `APPLICATION_UID` gets the object's UUID.

Your template must handle the following two scenarios:

- If the value for the property is `false` or empty, the template must
  include an `Application` object in the manifest. This object is applied
  to update the placeholder.

- If the value for the property is a UUID, the template must NOT include
  an `Application` object in its manifest.

If you are using Helm, do not include the `Application` object in the manifest.

Some tools, including Helm, stop the deployment if an object in the manifest
already exists, so the installation fails because of the placeholder
`Application`.

Use the following syntax to declare the UUID in `schema.yaml`:

```yaml
properties:
  appUid:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: APPLICATION_UID
      applicationUid:
        generatedProperties:
          createApplicationBoolean: global.application.create
```

- `createApplicationBoolean`: Indicates the property that gets the boolean
  value. You can use the boolean in the template to determine whether to
  include an `Application` resource in the manifest.

  If you're using Helm, you can do one of the following in the Helm chart:

  ```yaml
  {{- if not .Values.application_uid }}
  # Application object definition
  {{- end }}

  # OR ...

  {{- if .Values.global.application.create }}  # declared in createApplicationBoolean
  # Application object definition
  {{- end }}
  ```

#### type: ISTIO_ENABLED

This boolean property is `True` if the environment has [Istio](https://istio.io/)
enabled, and `False` otherwise. The deployer and template can use this signal to
adapt the deployment accordingly.

[Review the limitations for Google Cloud Marketplace apps on clusters that run Istio](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/kubernetes-solutions/create-app-package#istio-limitations).

#### type: INGRESS_AVAILABLE

This boolean property is `True` if the cluster has an Ingress controller. The
deployer and template can use this signal to adapt the deployment accordingly.

#### type: TLS_CERTIFICATE

This property provides an SSL/TLS certificate for the Kubernetes manifest. By
default, a self-signed certificate is generated.

The example below shows the syntax used to declare a certificate:

```yaml
properties:
  certificate:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: TLS_CERTIFICATE
      tlsCertificate:
        generatedProperties:
          base64EncodedPrivateKey: TLS_CERTIFICATE_KEY
          base64EncodedCertificate: TLS_CERTIFICATE_CRT
```

where:

* `base64EncodedPrivateKey` indicates the property that gets the private key.
* `base64EncodedCertificate` indicates the property that gets the certificate.

You can provide a custom certificate by overwriting the `certificate` property
in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
}
```

If you're using a Helm chart, you can handle the certificate like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: tls-secret
  namespace: demo
data:
  tls.key: {{ .Values.TLS_CERTIFICATE_KEY }}
  tls.crt: {{ .Values.TLS_CERTIFICATE_CRT }}
type: kubernetes.io/tls
```

If you're using an `envsubst` manifest, you can handle the certificate this
way:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: tls-secret
  namespace: demo
data:
  tls.key: $TLS_CERTIFICATE_KEY
  tls.crt: $TLS_CERTIFICATE_CRT
type: kubernetes.io/tls
```

### type: DEPLOYER_IMAGE

A property of this type receives the name of the deployer image that is used for
deploying the application. Use this property type instead of statically deriving
the deployer image name from other application images.

```yaml
properties:
  deployer:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: DEPLOYER_IMAGE
```

## clusterConstraints

This section is common to both `v1` and `v2` schemas.

Use `clusterConstraints` to specify the requirements for the Kubernetes
cluster. The requirements determine whether your app can be run on the
cluster. For example, you can specify that the cluster must be set up to run
a minimum number of replicas.

For example, the following `schema.yaml` specifies that the cluster must have
3 nodes, 256 MiB of memory, and 500 CPU millicores (0.5 CPU cores):

```yaml
properties:
  # Property definitions...
required:
  # Required properties...
x-google-marketplace:
  clusterConstraints:
    resources:
    - replicas: 3
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 256Mi
      affinity:
        simpleNodeAffinity:
          type: REQUIRE_ONE_NODE_PER_REPLICA
```

You can also define restrictions for the version of the cluster. For example, if the application
requires that the cluster runs k8s version greater than or equal to 1.13.7, use:

```yaml
x-google-marketplace:
  clusterConstraints:
    k8sVersion: ">=1.13.7"
```

Any SemVer expression is accepted; however, it is recommended that the constraints are kept to a
minimum, so the application is deployable over a wider range of clusters.

### resources

Each entry under `resources` is roughly equivalent to a workload in the app.

* `requests` defines the desired resource allocations, and is required for each
    entry.

* `replicas` is required for each entry (unless GPU requests are defined;
    [see GPUs](#gpus) for more details)

* `affinity` defines the relationship between the nodes and the replicas.

    * `simpleNodeAffinity` is an affinity definition. It has two types:

        * `REQUIRE_ONE_NODE_PER_REPLICA`: The number of nodes must be at least
          the same as the number of replicas, so that each replica is scheduled
          on a different node.
        * `REQUIRE_MINIMUM_NODE_COUNT`: The minimum number of nodes must be
          specified separately, in `minimumNodeCount`. For example:

```yaml
x-google-marketplace:
  clusterConstraints:
    resources:
    - replicas: 5
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
      affinity:
        simpleNodeAffinity:
          type: REQUIRE_MINIMUM_NODE_COUNT
          minimumNodeCount: 3
```

In the UI, if `resources` are specified, existing clusters will be checked
for sufficient available resources, and new clusters will be created with
the required amount of resources (higher than the stated requirement, as
not all cluster resources are available for workload use).

#### GPUs

An app may request at least one node with one or more GPUs with a supported,
compatible platform. For instance, the following specifies that at least one
Nvidia GPU must exist in the cluster:

```yaml
x-google-marketplace:
  clusterConstraints:
    resources:
    - requests:
        gpu:
          nvidia.com/gpu: {}
```

The following specifies that at least one node in the cluster should have at
least two Nvidia GPUs (with platform `nvidia-tesla-k80` or `nvidia-tesla-k100`):

```yaml
x-google-marketplace:
  clusterConstraints:
    resources:
    - requests:
        gpu:
          nvidia.com/gpu:
            limits: 2
            platforms:
            - nvidia-tesla-k80
            - nvidia-tesla-k100
```

Currently only Nvidia platforms are supported (requests entry key
`nvidia.com/gpus`). See the
[Compute Engine GPU guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus)
for a full list of available GPU platforms.

Note that for `resource` entries with GPU requests:

* `resources` may contain at most one entry with GPU requests
* `affinity` and `replicas` are ignored
* no other request types (e.g. `cpu`) can be defined in the same entry

In the UI, if a GPU request is specified, existing clusters will be checked for
sufficient compatible GPUs (workload availability is not checked). Due to the
complexity of requesting GPU quota, assisted cluster creation will be disabled,
and users will be informed of the GPU requirements and directed to the
[Kubernetes Engine GPU guide](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/gpus).

### istio

Use this section to indicate compatibility between the app and the Istio
service mesh installation in the cluster.

```yaml
properties:
  # Property definitions...
required:
  # Required properties...
x-google-marketplace:
  clusterConstraints:
    istio:
      type: OPTIONAL | REQUIRED | UNSUPPORTED
```

Supported types:
- `OPTIONAL`: The app works with Istio, but does not require it.
- `REQUIRED`: The app requires Istio to work properly.
- `UNSUPPORTED`: The app does not support Istio.

If this section is not specified, users see a warning when deploying the app to
an Istio-enabled environment. The [`ISTIO_ENABLED`](#type-istio_enabled) type
indicates whether Istio is enabled on the cluster.

### assistedClusterCreation

Use `assistedClusterCreation` to specify constraints for cluster creation as part of app deployment. These constraints determine whether a new cluster creation is allowed as part of deployment, and allow declaration of a specific node configuration for creation.

`assistedClusterCreation` is optional if cluster creation is enabled. You can use it to specify a specific node configuration, but otherwise one will be generated according to defaults or specified `clusterConstraints`, if declared. The node config defined here will override the one suggested by `clusterConstraints`.

```yaml
properties:
  # Property definitions...
required:
  # Required properties...
x-google-marketplace:
  clusterConstraints:
    assistedClusterCreation:
      type: DISABLED | STRICT
      creationGuidance: #string
      gke:
        nodePool:
        - numNodes: #integer
          machineType: #string
```

Supported types:
- `DISABLED`: The app doesn't support creating a new cluster as part of app deployment. User must select a pre-existing cluster.
- `STRICT`: The app specified strict requirements for number of nodes and machine type which should be used if creating a new cluster as part of app deployment. 

Use `creationGuidance` to specify instructions which will explain to end-user how they should create a cluster that will be compatible with the app. `creationGuidance` is required if constraint type is set as `DISABLED`.

For instance, the following specifies that a new cluster cannot be automatically created as part of deployment and the user should either select an existing cluster with Ubuntu node image or manually create one.

```yaml
properties:
  # Property definitions...
required:
  # Required properties...
x-google-marketplace:
  clusterConstraints:
    assistedClusterCreation:
      type: DISABLED
      creationGuidance: "Create a cluster with Ubuntu as the node image type."
```


The following specifies that if a new cluster was to be created as part of deployment, it should be a new `gke` cluster with a `nodePool` containing 2 nodes of custom machine-type `custom-2-12288`.

```yaml
properties:
  # Property definitions...
required:
  # Required properties...
x-google-marketplace:
  clusterConstraints:
    assistedClusterCreation:
      type: STRICT
      gke:
        nodePool:
        - numNodes: 2
          machineType: custom-2-12288
```
`numNodes` is number of nodes to be created in each of the cluster's zones.
`machineType` is the type of machine to use for nodes. It can either be a [predefined machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#general_purpose)  or [custom machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#custom_machine_types).

Only `gke` clusters and a single `nodePool` definition are supported at the moment.

## deployerServiceAccount

Nested under `x-google-marketplace` in schema V2, this can be used for
specifying custom roles for the deployer service account, including
cluster-scoped permissions. The deployer is granted `cluster-admin` in the
deployment **namespace** unless one or more roles with type `Role` are defined.
This property follows the exact same interface as the `x-google-marketplace`
`SERVICE_ACCOUNT` property type.

In accordance with the principle of least privilege, predefined
`cluster-admin`, `admin`, and `edit` are not supported as cluster-scoped
(`type: ClusterRole`) roles; `CUSTOM` roles defining specific rules must be
used instead.

The `description` field (required) should explain why the app needs the
requested permissions, particularly cluster-scoped permissions. It may be
shown to users in the UI.

Example:

```yaml
properties:
  # Property definitions...
required:
  # Required properties...
x-google-marketplace:
  deployerServiceAccount:
    description: >
      Creates app resources, including the MyAppCustomResource CRD.
    roles:
    - type: ClusterRole
      rulesType: CUSTOM
      rules:
      - apiGroups: ['apiextensions.k8s.io']
        resources: ['customresourcedefinitions']
        verbs: ['*']
```

## form

### help widget

You can add a blob of basic HTML text to the configuration form to provide
additional instruction for the installation process. The user sees this
before they deploy their app. (You should provide post-deployment instructions
in the `notes` section of the `Application` resource.)
You can use the following syntax:

```yaml
# This is at the top level of your schema.yaml
form:
- widget: help
  description: My arbitrary <i>description</i> text.
```

Note that currently only a single instance of this `help` widget can be specified.

The following HTML tags are allowed:
- Link: `<a href="https://www.google.com">link</a>`
- Heading: `<h2>`, `<h3>`
- Paragraph: `<p>`
- Text styling: `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<em>`
