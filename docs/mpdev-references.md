# Dev container references

## Overview and setup

Our dev container `gcr.io/cloud-marketplace-tools/k8s/dev`
bundles all the libraries needed for development.

When the dev container is run, gcloud configurations and
`kubeconfig` on the host are forwarded and used for invoking
`gcloud` and `kubectl`/k8s commands. To facilitate this,
the container has a script that can be extracted and used as
directly in your local environment.

The following creates an executable `mpdev` in your user bin
directory. Note: if there isn't already the `bin` directory in
your home directory, you'll need to create it and add it to `$PATH`,
or log out and log back in for it to be automatically added to `$PATH`.

```shell
BIN_FILE="$HOME/bin/mpdev"
docker run \
  gcr.io/cloud-marketplace-tools/k8s/dev \
  cat /scripts/dev > "$BIN_FILE"
chmod +x "$BIN_FILE"
```

Run the following to make sure that the dev tool is working:

```shell
mpdev
```

## Commands

### Diagnose your environment

The doctor tool inspects your setup and recommends potential
fixes.

```shell
mpdev doctor
```

### Install an application

This command is mostly equivalent to installing the application
from Marketplace UI.

```shell
mpdev install \
  --deployer=<YOUR DEPLOYER IMAGE> \
  --parameters=<PARAMETERS AS JSON DICTIONARY>

# For example:
mpdev install
  --deployer=gcr.io/your-company/your-solution/deployer \
  --parameters='{"name": "test-deployment", "namespace": "test-ns"}'
```

### Delete an application

You can delete an application by directly deleting the application
custom resource.

```shell
kubectl delete application <APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT NAME>
```

### Smoke test an application

This script creates a new namespace, deploys the application, waits
for it to turn green, run any smoke tests, and tears it down.
Make sure it runs successfully before submitting the application to marketplace.

```shell
mpdev verify \
  --deployer=<YOUR DEPLOYER IMAGE>
```

The `verify` command does not take parameters as in `install` command.
Instead, it will use the default values declared in the schema file.

If a property has no default value declared in `/data/schema.yaml`,
it has to be declared in `/data-test/schema.yaml` (with exception of `NAME` and `NAMESPACE`, which are auto-generated during verification).

For example, suppose `/data/schema.yaml` looks like the following:

```yaml
applicationApiVersion: v1beta1
properties:
  name:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAME

  namespace:
    type: string
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: NAMESPACE

  instances:
    type: int
    title: Number of instances
```

Since `instances` does not contain a default value, one needs to be declared in `/data-test/schema.yaml`, like so:

```yaml
properties:
  instances:
    type: int
    default: 2
```

Properties in `/data-test/schema.yaml` will overlay properties in `/data/schema.yaml`. This can also be used overwrite existing default values for verification.

## Installing a published Marketplace app

`mpdev` is intended for developing your application prior to publishing to
GCP Marketplace. It can also be used to deploy a published Marketplace app
following these steps.

### Locating the desired deployer image

From an app listing details page on Marketplace (for example
[nginx](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/google/nginx)),
locate the container repository path on the left hand side. Also notice
the image tag under `Container images` section.

![Repository path on listing details page](images/repository-path.png)

The desired deployer image is `[REPOSITORY_PATH]/deployer:[TAG]`.
Pull and make the image available locally.

```shell
IMAGE=[REPOSITORY_PATH]/deployer:[TAG]

docker pull $IMAGE
```

Inspect the schema of the deployer to determine the following:
- Schema version
- Parameters to fill out

```shell
docker run --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash $IMAGE -c 'cat /data/schema.yaml'
```

### Getting a copy of deploy parameters

To deploy an application, its required parameters have to be filled out.
One way is to fill out the parameters yourself. Another way to obtain these
parameters is to create a deployment using Marketplace UI and make a copy
of the parameters generated by the UI form, as follows.

```shell
APPLICATION_INSTANCE=nginx-1
APPLICATION_NAMESPACE=default

# Make sure that kubectl is pointing to the right cluster and
# no typos in the names. This should succeed.
kubectl get application/$APPLICATION_INSTANCE -n $APPLICATION_NAMESPACE

# Use the following for schema v2.
# Note: you need to have yaml install for python.
ARGS_JSON="$(kubectl get secret/$APPLICATION_INSTANCE-deployer-config \
  --namespace $APPLICATION_NAMESPACE \
  -o go-template='{{index .data "values.yaml"}}' \
  | base64 -d \
  | python -c 'import json, sys, yaml ; y=yaml.safe_load(sys.stdin.read()) ; print(json.dumps(y))')"

# Use the following for schema v1.
# Note: you need to have jq installed.
ARGS_JSON="$(kubectl get configmap/$APPLICATION_INSTANCE-deployer-config \
  --namespace $APPLICATION_NAMESPACE -o json \
  | jq '.data')"

echo $ARGS_JSON
```

### Installing the app

```shell
mpdev install \
  --deployer=$IMAGE \
  --parameters="$ARGS_JSON"
```
