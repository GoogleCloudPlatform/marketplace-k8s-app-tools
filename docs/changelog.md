# Release notes

## Managed updates beta release

* (Beta) You can now support managed updates for your applications. When you
  publish an updated version of the app, users can update the app in their
  clusters through the GCP Console.

    To support managed updates, you must [update your deployer's `schema.yaml`](schema.md)
    with additional fields such as release notes, type of update, and so on.
