# This cloudbuild.yaml config file is triggered when pull requests are
# merged into the master branch, and ensures that each commit on the
# master branch has build artifacts associated with it.
#
# Associated build triggers:
#
# marketplace-k8s-app-tools push to any branch
#   https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers/0762301f-81af-4c60-8d12-a4cbdf8d6ea1
